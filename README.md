# Contact Form

Contact Form is a simple full-stack web app (frontend here) to let you send me messages. That's proof of my intention to build a portfolio in the nearest future.
The web app is built with the MEAN stack (Angular, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB).

## Features
• The app is multilingual (with English and Arabic).

• All the data are dynamic (fetched from the database).

• Google ReCaptcha integrated into the contact form to prevent automated requests.

• The contact form design is customized based on a web template.

## Web Hosting
• The user interface deployed on Firebase.

• The web API deployed on Heroku with Git.

• The database deployed on Google Cloud with MongoDB Atlas.
